# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Annotaction!

Since this project is brand new as of August 2018, we'll keep things generic.
Issues and pull requests are more than welcomed - PRs can go right to the `master` branch.

Tests are crucial and exceptionally helpful if you find a bug or see something untested
and you'd like to contribute.

### Running Tests

    $ composer test
    
### Code Styles

Annotaction uses [PHP CS Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) to automatically
address code styles. Before you submit your pull request, make sure to run it:

    $ composer fix-cs
